### Chapter 00

- 3 major components of `stdlib`: 
    - containers
    - iterators
    - algorithms

- Core of the language -> *object life cycle*:
    - strong guarantees that resources will release correctly even if error conditions occur.

- The strong type system is a prime example of zero-overhead abstraction in C, in the downstream assembly
    there is no trace of types.

- C++ also takes zero-overhead abstraction and direct mapping to hardware seriously.
